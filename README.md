# Probability of Winning a BlackJack Game
In this side project a friend and I analyzed the probability of winning a game of Blackjack depending on the strategy the player used. We achieved this by simulating thousands of Blackjack games by using mathematical probability models and Python code. In the end, we successfully were able to predict which strategy was the most effective based on the average amount of games the player won while using the strategy.
