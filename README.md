# Probability of Winning a BlackJack Game
In this side project a friend and I analyzed the probability of winning a game of Blackjack depending on the strategy the player used. We achieved this by simulating thousands of Blackjack games by using mathematical probability models and Python code using Jupyter Notebooks. In the end, we successfully were able to predict which strategy was the most effective based on the average amount of games the player won while using the strategy.

## Recommended IDE Setup
Any IDE that supports Python can run the code as long as the modules used are installed correctly beforehand.

For an easy visualization of the code, I recommend using [Google Collab](https://colab.google/), a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use while providing access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs.
